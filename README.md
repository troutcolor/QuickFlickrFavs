## Settings

At the moment there is only one for a FlickrApi key which you need to have.

You can get one from [Flickr Services](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html)

As of version 0.1 the whole this is pretty simple. It could easily be extended to show latest photos, albums etc.
